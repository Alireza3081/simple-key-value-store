# Simple Key-Value Store
This project is a simple Key-Value database written in Python.
It allows you to store, get, delete, and show data using text commands:
set -> Saves a key with its value
get -> Retrieves a value using the key
show -> Displays all saved key-value pairs
The data is saved inside a JSON file (`database.json`), meaning that even after closing the program, the values will still exist.

Also The repository includes a file named Dockerfile, which allows the Key-Value Store app to run inside a Docker container.
